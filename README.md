# Prebiotic-Compound-Enrichment-for-LUCA-Associated-Protein-Targets
Data and analysis supporting significant enrichment of LUCA-associated protein targets among prebiotic compounds relative to clinical and physicochemically matched controls.

Data generated throughout the analysees are contained in the data folder.

This repository contains original analyses exploring the relationship between
prebiotic-like chemistry and evolutionary conservation of protein targets.
The central hypothesis and experimental design were conceived by
Ludvik Espeland in 2025.

These materials are shared to support transparency and reproducibility.
