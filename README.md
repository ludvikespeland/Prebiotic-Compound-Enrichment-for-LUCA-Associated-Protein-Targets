# Prebiotic Compound Enrichment for LUCA-Associated Protein Targets

## Overview
This repository contains data files and summary analyses supporting the finding
that prebiotic-like small molecules are significantly enriched for interactions
with LUCA-associated (Last Universal Common Ancestor) protein targets, relative
to both clinical compounds and physicochemically matched non-prebiotic controls.

The work explores the relationship between prebiotic-like chemical space and the
evolutionary provenance of protein targets, with a focus on deeply conserved
protein families spanning multiple domains of life.

## Scope and Status
This repository represents a **partial public release** intended to support
transparency, reproducibility, and scholarly attribution. Certain intermediate
datasets and end-to-end analysis pipelines are
not yet included and will be made available in connection with a formal
preprint or manuscript.

## Authorship and Priority
The central hypothesis, analytical framework, evolutionary interpretation and relevance 
for medicinal chemistry were conceived and developed by **Ludvik O. Espeland** in **2025**.

These materials are shared to document the original analysis and to support
scientific transparency.
