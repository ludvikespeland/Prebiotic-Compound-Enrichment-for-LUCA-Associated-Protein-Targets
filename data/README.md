# Data Directory

This directory contains **redacted, summary-level datasets** supporting the
analysis of enrichment of LUCA-associated protein targets among prebiotic-like
compounds.

## Data Scope
The files provided here include:
- Aggregated activity metrics (e.g., potency summaries, measurement counts)
- Physicochemical descriptors used for matching and control analyses
- Evolutionary annotations and categorical classifications (e.g., LUCA status)

To support responsible early sharing, **compound identifiers, molecular
structures, protein accessions, and assay-level details have been removed**
from these public versions.

Each dataset is provided as an individually zipped CSV file.

## Availability
Complete identifier-level datasets and fully reproducible analysis inputs will
be made available in connection with a formal preprint or peer-reviewed
manuscript.

## Authorship
Data generation and analysis were performed by **Ludvik O. Espeland (2025)**.
